What does this do?
- This is a Discord Webhook logger for when a person types something in an input and enters it in. This type of input is like a password input. You can only gain access if you enter in the correct answer. If they put the correct answer, it sends to discord saying correct! If they put in a wrong answer, It gets sent to discord saying Wrong! following with what they said.

What you need to change for it to work:

- Input IDs to whatever you want (In HTML)
- Redirect variable (to whatever location you want to redirect)
- stay variable (the same website this file is on. So when they get it wrong, it does nothing so they can try again, or you can redirect them if you want)
- text variable (to get the input data so the password can work)
- content variable (to get its input data for when they are wrong or right)
